# Ecology App with React.js

This application was created to help all inhabitants of our planet Earth learn more about waste sorting. It's important because there has been a growing concern about waste on our planet recently. Therefore, this application will educate people on which products should be disposed of in which bins.

### Features
- **Game**: Our application features a game where users can move trash into the correct bins, helping them memorize where each item should be disposed of.
- **Uniqueness**: While exploring the vastness of the internet, we haven't encountered any similar pages with this functionality.

### Used Technologies
- **React.js**: This framework was used to develop all the functionality on our page.
- **React Drag and Drop**: This library was utilized to implement the drag and drop functionality for moving trash into the bins.

### How to Use
1. Upon entering the website, users are greeted with the homepage, which immediately offers them to start playing the game.
